\chapter{Implications of codon–anticodon interaction on the regulation of translation}

Shortly after the publication of our research on \trna gene regulation during
mouse development, \citet{Gingold:2014} published a paper titled \texttitle{A
Dual Program for Translation Regulation in Cellular Proliferation and
Differentiation}. They report that different programmes of cellular function
preferentially use different sets of codons, and that the pool of active
\trna[s] in adapts dynamically to decode this set of codons with high
efficiency.

This stands in contrast to our findings that the pool of codons, and especially
the pool of anticodons, remains stable across highly different conditions. We
therefore set out to harmonise these, on the face of it, opposing claims.

\section{Challenges in the interpretation of codon–anticodon interaction}

Summarise our objections:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We find a stable codon and \trna pool, no adaptation to specific cellular
conditions

    \item Their analysis does not exclude alternative explanations (which I partially
(?) list here)

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item size of \mrna subsets is a strong covariant, with small subsets
                showing larger variation on codon usage bias, purely due to
                sampling variation
            \item correlation is not just with codon usage but also amino acid
                usage. How is that possible if the codons control translation?
            \item evolutionarily, codon bias does not seem conserved, which
                makes it hard to think of it as a conserved driver of regulation
            \item perfect correlation of codon usage and GC bias, may hint at
                the existence of a more fundamental relationship on the
                transcriptional level
            \item failing adaptation of \emph{anti}codon pool poses big problem
                for theory that subsets of \mrna may be adapted to
        \end{enumerate}
