\chapter{Introduction}

\section{The central dogma}

At the core of every living being is its genetic inheritance. The genetic
inheritance is what is being passed down from parents to their offspring, and
contains a blueprint detailing how to construct a new individual in a process
called \define{embryogenesis}. This genetic inheritance is physically present in
the form of \dna in every living cell\footnote{And to some extent in non-living
particles called \define{viruses}.}.

If the \dna is a library containing a blueprint of the cellâ€™s instructions, then
there is need also for librarians, and for workers who enact the instructions
found in the blueprint and conveyed by the librarians. These find their
counterparts in living cells in the form of \mrna and \define{proteins}. The
process by which genetic information is stored in the \dna, conveyed by
\mrna[s], and enacted by proteins is formalised in the \emph{Central Dogma of
molecular biology}.
