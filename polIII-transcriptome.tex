\chapter{The \abbr{pol3} transcriptome consists of more than just \abbr{trna}}

Less than \num{5} per cent of the mammalian genome is protein coding. Much less
than \num{1} per cent codes for \trna[s]. Indeed, most of the genome as we know
it is devoid of any coding information. Nevertheless, \pol3 transcription can
occur at a much wider range, and \trna genes form only a tiny part of the
overall \pol3 transcriptome. In this chapter we are going to take a look at the
other part of the \pol3 transcriptome, with a special focus on one class of
\define{retrotransposons}: \abbr{transsine}s.
