\chapter{Supplementary material for \texorpdfstring{\cref*{sec:trna}}{chapter 2}}

The material in this section has been taken from the supplementary figures \&
methods of Schmitt, Rudolph,\andothersdelim\& al. [\cite*{Schmitt:2014}] with
minimal changes to the figure legends. The figures and their captions have been
created jointly by Bianca Schmitt, Claudia Kutter and me.

    {Workflow of the genome-wide identification and analysis of protein-coding
    and \trna genes.}
    {(A) \rnaseq analysis of protein-coding gene expression, differential
    expression analysis and codon usage analysis. (B) \chipseq analysis of \pol3
    occupancy at \trna gene loci, differential expression analysis of \trna
    genes, and anticodon isoacceptor abundance analysis.}
