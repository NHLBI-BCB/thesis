\chapter{Supplementary material for \texorpdfstring{\cref*{sec:trna}}{chapter 2}}

The material in this section has been taken from the supplementary figures \&
methods of Schmitt, Rudolph,\andothersdelim\& al. [\cite*{Schmitt:2014}] with
minimal changes to the figure legends. The figures and their captions have been
created jointly by Bianca Schmitt, Claudia Kutter and me.
