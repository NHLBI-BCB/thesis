\chapter{Analysis challenges concerning tRNA expression data}

We quantified \trna gene expression via \pol3 \chipseq. The reason for using
this, on the first glance indirect, measure, is caused by the fact that \trna
genes are unfortunately not identifiable by their sequence alone: performing a
multiple sequence alignment of \trna genes in \mmu reveals that several \trna
genes share the exact same sequence.
