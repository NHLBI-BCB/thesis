\section{Quantifying expression of \trna genes}

We quantified \trna gene expression via \pol3 \chipseq. The reason for using
this, on the first glance indirect, measure is caused by the fact that \trna
genes are unfortunately not identifiable by their sequence alone: performing a
multiple sequence alignment of \trna genes in \mmu reveals that several \trna
genes share the exact same sequence.

In order to identify individual \trna genes and quantify their expression, we
therefore cannot resort to conventional \rnaseq: the \rna reads covering only
the transcribed gene region are indistinguishable.

With the \pol3 \chipseq data, we do not have this problem: reads cover both the
transcribed sequence and the flanking regions of each gene
(\cref{fig:trna-pol3-binding-profile}).

    {The shaded, bell-shaped area shows an idealised binding profile of \chipseq
    data spanning the \trna gene with the A and B box highlighted, as well as
    its flanking regions upstream and downstream of the gene body. This overlap
    plays a role in identifying the individual gene.}

When mapping the reads, we therefore do not discard all non-uniquely mapping
reads as is otherwise customary.\footnote{We still discard reads which are
likely \pcr duplicates, i.e.\ map to many locations; we more or less arbitrarily
used the threshold of \num{50} non-unique mapping locations} We thus end up with
reads which have not been assigned to a given \trna gene
(\cref{fig:trna-pol3-map-ambiguous-reads}). In order to assign these reads to
\trna genes, we \emph{reallocated} reads after mapping, using the number of
uniquely mapping reads in \trna genes’ flanking regions to determine the most
likely origin (\cref{fig:trna-pol3-map-ambiguous-reads}) \citep{Kutter:2011}.

Formally, let \(i\) be the \(i\)th \trna gene locus, and \(c_i\) be the count of
uniquely mapped reads in its flanking region (we used \SI{\pm100}{bp}). A
multi-mapping read \(r\), which maps to a set \(T\) of candidate \trna[s], can
be allocated to a target \trna gene \(i\) randomly with probability

\begin{equation}
    p_i = \begin{cases}
        {c_i}/{\sum_{x \in T}c_x} & \text{if \(\sum_{x \in T}c_x \neq 0\),} \\
        {1}/{\vert T \rvert} & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Normalisation of \trna gene expression}

Raw \trna gene expression counts show strong differences between sequencing
libraries. For \mrna count data, it is customary to use \name{DEseq}’s
\dfn{library size normalisation} \citep{Anders:2010}. However, as shown in
\cref{fig:trna-libraries-example}, library size normalised data still follows
distinct distributions, which we deem biologically implausible, and probably due
to technical bias.

As a consequence, we opted to \dfn{quantile normalise} the count data\todo{find
reference for quantile normalisation}.
